This repository contains a python implementation of the reduced complexity ice-age model presented in Talento & Ganopolski (2021), employed in my master thesis. The implementation is based on the description in the paper and accompanying MatLab code available at https://osf.io/kb76g/, where you will also find the orbital forcing used as an input to the model and palaeo ice-volume (sea stack) records to which the model was calibrated.
